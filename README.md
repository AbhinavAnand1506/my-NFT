# my-NFT
This last project will bring together everything you've learned with a little Web3 spice for flavor!  For your project, you will mint NFTs! Ok, not really, but we can pretend, yes? You will simulate this by writing some JavaScript code that will create an object that represents your NFT and that will hold its metadata.
